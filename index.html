                This section introduces the fundamental concept of a value stock and the core thinking behind this investment approach.

                    Imagine you're at a store and find a high-quality, brand-name item on a clearance rack. You know it's worth more, but for some reason‚Äîmaybe it's last season's model or the box is slightly dented‚Äîit's selling for much less than its usual price. Buying it is a smart deal because you're getting something valuable for less than its true worth.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">
                    A <span class="accent-color">value stock</span> is just like that. It's a share of a solid, good company that the stock market is currently selling at a discount.

                <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Value investors believe that the market isn't always perfect. Sometimes, due to temporary problems or just a lack of attention, a company's stock price can drop below what the company is actually worth. The goal is to find these "bargains" and hold onto them, waiting for the market to realize their true value and for the price to go back up. This approach is all about thinking long-term and doing your homework.

            <p class="section-subtitle text-center">
                Finding value stocks isn't guesswork. Investors use specific tools and careful analysis to determine a company's true worth.

                    This is like being a detective. Value investors carefully examine a company's financial reports (like its income, assets, and cash flow) to understand how healthy and profitable the business truly is. The goal is to estimate the company's "intrinsic value" ‚Äì what it's *really* worth, regardless of its current stock price.

                    These are common ratios that help compare a company's stock price to its financial performance. A low number often suggests a potential value stock, but it's crucial to look at them together and understand their context.

                    <li><strong>Industry Outlook:</strong> Is the industry stable, or is it facing major, long-term problems?</li>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    This is a core idea. It means buying a stock for significantly less than your estimated true value. For example, if you think a company is worth $100 per share, you might only buy it if the price is $70 or less. This "safety buffer" protects you if your initial estimate was a bit off or if unexpected problems arise.
